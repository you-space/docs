# Origins

Origins are how you-space handle importing external content.

The origin itself is just a way to schedule imports and configure the necessary information that a provider needs to execute the importation.

And the providers are scripts that will handle the process of requesting the content of an external API and then add the content to the you-space.

Providers are added to system using plugins, you can check the [list of available plugins here](./plugin-list.md) or install they directly in plugins-list-page
