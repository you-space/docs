# Types

Types are entities defined in the system and they are a way to group the items in your you-space instance, they are also very similar to wordpress [custom-post-types](https://wordpress.org/support/article/post-types/) but a little more generic.

They are used to manage internal content like local videos or some external content like youtube videos.

Types are also responsible for define how the related items will be displayed and edited in you-space instance.

Usually a plugin will create the types and do all necessary configuration, but you can also create types manually in type-list page, check [How to create a new type](/tutorials/how-to-create-a-new-type.md) to know more about.
