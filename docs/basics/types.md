# Types

Types are entities defined in the you-space, they are very similar to wordpress [custom-post-types](https://wordpress.org/support/article/post-types/) but a little more generic.

Types can be used to manage internal content like local videos or some external content like youtube videos.

They are also responsible for configure the fields that the items entity have like **video_src**, **thumbnail_src** and how this is edited in the dashboard with a file-picker for example.

Usually a plugin will create the types and made all necessary configuration but you can also create your own types in type-list page.
