# Types

Types are a generic way to define an entity in the system, very similar to wordpress [custom-post-types](https://wordpress.org/support/article/post-types/)

They are used to group items and format they as you needed with [fields](/types/fields.md), filters, etc. Also is used by plugins to manage and update items that they have imported.

Examples of what could be a type in the system:

-   youtube-videos
-   youtube-comments
-   twitter-tweets
-   articles
